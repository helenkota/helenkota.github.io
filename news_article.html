    <h1><i>Matilda the Musical</i> - NJUCA's latest show!</h1>
        <p>This spring, NJUCA put on the show <i>Matilda the Musical</i>! It was a very fun experience for all of the cast and crew members who were in this production. We want our show next year to be just as successful, if not more, than this one!</p>
    <h2>Cool Facts!</h2>
        <p><i>Matilda</i> was very different than the past musicals and plays we have done at NJUCA, and there are several reasons why. This show was our <em>first</em> full length musical at NJUCA! It was 2 and a half hours long, and the other musicals we have done were junior musicals that were only 1 hour long. Also, for this show we used professional costumes that we rented from a costume company.</p>
    <p>Another amazing feature of this show was the spectacular set! Every student at NJUCA helped work on the set during Missions Week. They helped to build and paint the boxes, the walls, and some of the furniture used in the show.</p>
    <p><q>Thank you to Mrs. Korey for being an amazing director!!!</q> -- <i>Matilda</i> cast & crew </p>
